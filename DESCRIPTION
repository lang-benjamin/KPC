Description: Kernel partial correlation (KPC) coefficient measures the strength of conditional
    association between Y and Z given X, with X, Y, Z being random variables taking values
    in general topological spaces. As the name suggests, KPC is defined in terms of kernels
    on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The population KPC is a deterministic
    number between 0 and 1; it is 0 if and only if Y is conditionally independent of Z given X,
    and it is 1 if and only if Y is a measurable function of Z and X. This R package provides
    implementations of two empirical versions of KPC when X, Z are Euclidean, and Y, possibly
    taking values in a general topological space, can be stored as a vector. One empirical KPC
    estimator is based on geometric graphs, such as K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) graphs and minimum
    spanning trees (MST), and is consistent under very weak conditions. The other empirical
    estimator, defined using conditional mean embeddings (CMEs) as used in the RKHS literature,
    is also consistent under suitable conditions. Users are allowed to define arbitrary kernels.
    Using KPC we also provide a stepwise forward variable selection algorithm KFOCI
    (using the graph based estimator of KPC), as well as a similar stepwise forward selection
    algorithm based on the RKHS based estimator. For more details on KPC, its empirical estimators
    and its application on variable selection, see (link to the paper). When X is empty, KPC
    measures the unconditional dependence between Y and Z, which is also implemented in the
    package. The unconditional graph-based estimator has been described in Deb, N., P. Ghosal,
    and B. Sen (2020), “Measuring association on topological spaces using kernels and geometric
    graphs” <arXiv:2010.01768>. It is implemented in the functions 'Kmac' and 'Klin' in this
    package. The latter can be computed in near linear time.
